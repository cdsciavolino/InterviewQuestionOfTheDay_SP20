# InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20
COS 226 Precept P04A Spring 2020 - All interview questions of the day with solutions

Each week, I'll post the solution to a common interview problem I've either encountered or given to candidates. I'll try and keep the list of problems below up to date!

- [Max Profit for Single Stock Trade](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L26) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)): Given a list of stock prices over a series of days, find the maximum profit possible by executing a single trade (one buy and one sell).

- [Apartment Ocean View](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L44): Given a list of building heights, suppose there is an ocen view at the end of the array. A building has an ocean view if its height is greater than all buildings between it and the ocean. Count the number of buildings with an ocean view.

- [Merge Intervals](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L77) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)): Given a list of intervals of the form `[startTime, endTime]` that may or may not be overlapping, merge any overlapping intervals.

- [Product Excluding Self](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L122) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)): Given a list of numbers, return an array where `output[i]` is the product of all the numbers in the list except `nums[i]`. Main challenge: can you do this without division and using linear time with constant space?

- [k-Nearest Restaurants](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L164):Given a list of xy-coordinates of restaurants and a coordinate for a home, return the k-nearest restaurants to the home.

- [k Most Frequent Words](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L259): Given a (potentially very large) corpus string of space-separated words and a list of skip words to omit, return the k-most frequently occurring words that do not appear in the list of omitted words.

- [Number of Islands](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L304) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)): Given a grid of 0s and 1s, return the number of unique islands there are (1 being land and 0 being ocean). Assume the grid edges are the ocean and land connections can only be adjacent non-diagonally (up, down, left, right).

- [Min Word Transform](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L373) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)): Given two words and a list of all possible words, find the minimum number of operations to convert from the start word to the end word using only words in wordList. Each transformation changes a single character at a time.

- [LRU Cache](https://github.com/cdsciavolino/InterviewQuestionOfTheDay_SP20/blob/master/IQOD/src/QuestionSolutions.java#L452) ([Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)): Given a positive capacity, design an LRU cache that supports `get(key)` operations and `put(key, value)` operations in constant time.
